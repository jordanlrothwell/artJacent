## User Story:

- As an artwork developer (e.g. sculpturist, metal work artist, paintist, street artist), I want an application where I can safely display my artwork to interested parties to view.

- When I sign up to the application, I can safely upload and share my work to interested parties for view.

- So that I can connect and share my interest for art development with other artwork developers. Also, be able to network and form future collaboration with other artwork developers.

## Project Description:

artJacent intends to provide artwork developers a safe place to display their artwork to interested parties for view. Their artwork will only be available to exclusive people, whom have signed up to our application.

It's also an application that will enable artwork developers to network and form collaborations with other people on future projects.
E.g. a sculpturist can display their work on artJacent. If an interior designer may of happen to view their work, and is interest in this person's work. artJacent will enable the interior designer to network with the sculpturist.
